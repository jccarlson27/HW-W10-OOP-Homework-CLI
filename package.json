  "description": "This challenge is to build a Node CLI that takes in information about employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Since testing is a key piece in making code maintainable, you will also be ensuring that all unit tests pass.\r ## Instructions\r You will build a software engineering team generator command line application. The application will prompt the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns. This assignment must also pass all unit tests. When the user has completed building the team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user.\r ```\r As a manager\r I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info\r so that I have quick access to emails and GitHub profiles\r ```\r How do you deliver this? Here are some guidelines:\r * Use the [Inquirer npm package](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/) to prompt the user for their email, id, and specific information based on their role with the company.\r * Your app will run as a Node CLI to gather information about each employee.\r The dependencies are, [jest](https://jestjs.io/) for running the provided tests, and [inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) for collecting input from the user.\r ## Minimum Requirements\r * Functional application.\r * GitHub repository with a unique name and a README describing the project.\r * User can use the CLI to generate an HTML page that displays information about their team.\r * All tests must pass.\r ### Classes\r The project must have the these classes: `Employee`, `Manager`, `Engineer`,\r `Intern`. The tests for these classes in the `tests` directory must all pass.\r ### User input\r The project must prompt the user to build an engineering team. An engineering\r team consists of a manager, and any number of engineers and interns.\r ### Roster output\r The project must generate a `team.html` page in the `output` directory, that displays a nicely formatted team roster. Each team member should display the following in no particular order:\r   * Name\r   * Role\r   * ID\r   * Role-specific property (School, link to GitHub profile, or office number)\r ## Finish Assignment:\r Please view the deployed project:\r ### Directory structure:\r ```\r lib/           // classes and helper code\r   Employee.js\r   Engineer.js\r   Intern.js\r   Manager.js\r output/        // rendered output\r   team.html\r templates/     // HTML template(s)\r   templateHTML.js\r test/          // jest tests\r   Employee.test.js\r   Engineer.test.js\r   Intern.test.js\r   Manager.test.js\r app.js         // Runs the application\r .gitignore\r package-lock.json\r package.json\r ```",
